# Sunspot

**How much sun does this spot actually get?**

Every seed packet, plant label and solar-panel spec is written in hours of direct sun.
Almost nobody knows what their own garden, balcony or roof actually gets — so the tomatoes
go in the shady corner and never ripen, and the panels go on the side of the roof the
neighbour's lime tree shades from October.

Sunspot answers the question with a number.

Other sun apps show you where the sun is. That is the easy half. The half that decides the
answer is what stands in the way: the fence, the garage, the tree next door. Sunspot lets
you trace that skyline with the camera, then walks the day a minute at a time and counts
only the light that actually reaches the spot.

## Status

Built, translated, and shot for the store. 187 tests pass; the purchase has been made on a
real phone and the skyline has been traced on one. iPhone only, iOS 17 and up, one payment
that never expires.

On a first real tracing session the app captured 860 directions covering 217° of horizon —
94% of the 251° the sun crosses at that latitude — with no compass jitter: the line deviated
0.57° on average from its own local mean. That spot gets nine hours of sun in late August and
none at all in December, which is exactly the sort of answer the app exists to give.

## The engine

`Packages/SolarCore` is a standalone Swift package with no dependencies. It runs anywhere
Swift runs, which means the maths can be tested from the command line without a simulator.

```bash
cd Packages/SolarCore
swift test
```

What it does:

- **`Solar.position(at:coordinate:)`** — the sun's azimuth and elevation for any place and
  moment, using the standard low-precision equations from Meeus's *Astronomical Algorithms*.
- **`HorizonProfile`** — the skyline around a spot, as a ring of measured heights that
  interpolates between samples and wraps across north.
- **`Solar.sunDay(containing:coordinate:timeZone:horizon:)`** — stretches of direct sun,
  the total, the first and last sun, and the longest unbroken run.
- **`Solar.sunYear(year:coordinate:timeZone:horizon:)`** — the same figure for every day of
  the year, for showing a bed that bakes in July sitting in shadow from October.
- **`SunExposure`** — grades a spot the way plant labels are worded: full sun, part sun,
  part shade, full shade.

### On accuracy

The engine is checked two ways, because self-consistency is not correctness.

**Against physics.** Quantities fixed by the geometry of the solar system, not by any
implementation of it: declination peaking at the axial tilt on the solstices and crossing
zero at the equinoxes, noon elevation equal to 90° minus the angle between your latitude and
the sun's, the noon sun due south in the northern hemisphere and due north in the southern,
midnight sun above the Arctic Circle and polar night below the Antarctic, the equation of
time staying inside its known envelope.

**Against the world.** Sunrise and sunset were compared with two independent providers on
2026-08-24. Where those two disagreed with each other, this engine matched Open-Meteo to
within a fraction of a minute; a separate check showed the other provider places sunrise
with the sun's centre near −1.08°, rather than the −0.833° its own documentation specifies.
Those reference times are pinned in `SunriseReferenceTests` so the agreement cannot quietly
rot.

Sunrise is taken at the moment the sun's apparent upper limb clears the skyline — 34
arcminutes of atmospheric refraction plus the disc's own 16-arcminute radius. Comparing the
bare geometric centre against a flat horizon instead costs a spot five to twelve minutes at
each end of the day, depending on latitude. Transitions are refined by bisection rather than
left on a one-minute grid, because a grid error always falls the same way and shortens the
day.

## Layout

```
Packages/SolarCore/        the maths, dependency-free and testable from a terminal
  Sources/SolarCore/
    Geometry.swift             coordinates, angles
    SolarPositionCalculator.swift  where the sun is
    HorizonProfile.swift       what stands in the way
    SunHours.swift             what that adds up to
  Tests/SolarCoreTests/
```

## Tools

```
Tools/check.sh              engine, build, purchase configuration, translations, app tests
Tools/screenshots.sh        the App Store set — six screens, no taps
Tools/check-localisation.py the keys SwiftUI would look up, checked against the catalogue
Tools/make-project.py       regenerates Sunspot.xcodeproj
Tools/build-site.py         the pages served from docs/
```

`check.sh` is the one to run after a change; the rest it calls or you call by hand.

`make-project.py` writes the scheme byte for byte as Xcode writes it, so opening Edit Scheme
no longer produces a diff and regenerating no longer undoes what Xcode just saved. The
StoreKit configuration path in it has always been correct; what used to change underneath it
was the formatting of the file around it.

There is no analytics, no account, no server and no third-party SDK. Nothing the app works
out leaves the phone, which is why the privacy manifest declares one API and no collected
data at all.

The screenshot set is seeded from a launch argument rather than by tapping through the app,
so it can be thrown away and shot again from scratch whenever a screen moves. The same
garden, the same traced skyline, the same half past one in the afternoon, every time.
English by default; `Tools/screenshots.sh de fr` shoots the other two, in gardens of their
own. One frame is worth retaking by hand: the Sky screen has a real camera behind it on a
phone and a plain gradient in a simulator, and the gradient sells nothing.

The frames themselves are not committed; `screenshots/README.md`, beside them, says which
frame goes in which slot in App Store Connect and what Apple checks.
